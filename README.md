# Best Exotic Project

Hi, this is the repo for the Best Exotic Porject--an education platform I have been developing for my work with the 
Minerva Incubator last summer and the Minerva Institute this fall. The best way to learn more about what we're been 
doing is to check out [our website](best-exotic.github.io).

### About the repository
We're writing the website on the MERN stack. Here are the interesting scripts.

`yarn storybook` will open the Storybook for the project, where can look the components we've been building.
